Dynamic 1.4.0.0
=====================

Intro
-----
The Dynamic(DYN) blockchain exists in the Duality binary architecture as a DAO, whilst [Sequence(SEQ)](https://github.com/duality-solutions/sequence) is its real world interface. Dynamic uses peer-to-peer technology to operate securly with no central authority (decentralisation): managing transactions and issuing currency (DYN) are carried out collectively by the Dynamic network. Dynamic is the name of open source software which enables the use of the currency DYN.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run dynamic-qt.exe.

Dynamic is the original Dynamic client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Dynamic transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
